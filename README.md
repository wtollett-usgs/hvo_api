# HVO-API
---
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wtollett-usgs/hvo_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wtollett-usgs/hvo_api)

HVO-API is a companion application for the [vsc-vdx](https://github.com/usgs/vsc-vdx) project. The idea is to be able to extract JSON data from VDX databases (and a few other random sources) using easily constructable URLs. Initially written as a way to learn the datasets in use at HVO, it's been continually expanded as users have requested access to different data.

The app can be run as a desktop flask app via app.py, via a WSGI server with the run.wsgi script, or inside a docker container (see Dockerfile). If in a container, expected mounts are:
* config file (see sample in hvo_api/conf) at /app/hvo_api/conf/prod.py
* logfile to /app/hvo_api/error_logs (optional)

## Requirements
---
At a high level, you'd need the following to get any use out of this codebase:
1. Python 3 and the packages listed in requirements.txt
2. A webserver that can run python apps
3. Some data to fetch. Note that VDX databases aren't explicitly required, but the code does expect the tables to have specific fields.
